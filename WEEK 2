WEEK 2

We borrowed $1000 at a 10% annual interest rate. If we did not make a payment for two years, 
and assuming there is no penalty for non-payment, how much do we owe now? Assign the result to a variable called debt.


SOLUTION CODE

Borrowed_money = 1000;
Interest_rate = 10/100;
Delay_year = 2;
 
debt = Borrowed_money*(1+Interest_rate)^Delay_year

OUTPUT SOLUTION

debt =

   1.2100e+03
