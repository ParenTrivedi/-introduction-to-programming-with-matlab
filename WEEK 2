WEEK 2

****ASSIGNMENT:- MATLAB CALCULATION*****
We borrowed $1000 at a 10% annual interest rate. If we did not make a payment for two years, 
and assuming there is no penalty for non-payment, how much do we owe now? Assign the result to a variable called debt.


SOLUTION CODE

Borrowed_money = 1000;
Interest_rate = 10/100;
Delay_year = 2;
 
debt = Borrowed_money*(1+Interest_rate)^Delay_year

OUTPUT SOLUTION

debt =

   1.2100e+03
   
******ASSIGNMENT:- Lesson 1 Wrap-up***********


1. As of early 2018, Usain Bolt holds the world record in the men's 100-meter dash. 
It is 9.58 seconds. What was his average speed in km/h?  Assign the result to a variable called hundred.
2. Kenyan Eliud Kipchoge set a new world record for men of 2:01:39 on September 16, 2018. 
Assign his average speed in km/h to the variable marathon. The marathon distance is 42.195 kilometers.



SOLUTION CODE

y=0.1/9.58;
hundred=y*3600
x=42.195/((121*60)+39);
marathon=x*3600
